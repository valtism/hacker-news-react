I’m not very familiar with ACT, but as an offshoot of CBT that includes a mindfulness component, it sounds fascinating.<p>Burns talks about the “do one small thing” strategy in his books, and (anecdotally) it can be very effective. When you’re at a point where even the small step seems impossible, he has tips on drilling into the underlying emotions. Ultimately, your brain sees the discomfort associated with <i>not</i> working on something as outweighing the discomfort of actually doing it. Often, this is a cognitive distortion — which CBT aims to help one sort through. And sometimes the task really <i>isn’t</i> worth doing.<p>I know I go on a lot about meditation in my comments, but (again n=1) it can help clarify thoughts and emotions — particularly the kind of cognitive distortions that lead to self-destructive habits. Now I’m curious to learn more about ACT...",

However, once I got into the workforce, and it took me many years to realize it, that performing to the &quot;mean&quot; was not where I wanted to be.<p>The turning point for me was finally getting an ADHD (particularly the attention side, as an adult) diagnosis and being treated for it. Once I started on Adderall, I finally saw myself able to put in the same efforts as others and it felt like I was able to get ahead of others in terms of performance.<p>Besides the chemicals helping, just being able to focus better made it easier for me to figure out what systems I need to in place to ensure I&#x27;m staying on top of things and being productive. You often hear this advice but for someone who has a difficult time starting things, the idea of &quot;building systems&quot; is overwhelming.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m at the point where I&#x27;m confident enough to taking the pills but I&#x27;m pretty sure if I did, I&#x27;d be better off than I was before I started.",

        "I have been remote working for many years. And I have done a handful of office working. I would have considered myself (probably wrongly) the worst procrastinator. It seemed like most of the people I worked with were able to get things done better than I could.<p>And I have been on the &quot;overwork&quot; part of the spectrum where I&#x27;m all about working until burnout.<p>It&#x27;s about emotions, yes. But that&#x27;s not very specific. This is one of those subjects where 10 different people could give 10 different explanations and nobody would be wrong. It&#x27;s a rat&#x27;s nest of issues. A bunch of threads tightly wound to create a mess of a problem.<p>Fixing a procrastination problem probably takes more of a gut feel than an attempt to understand it.<p>I don&#x27;t know what causes it, but most of the time what fixes it is focus.<p>Why do students cram? Because time constraints strip away the BS and they&#x27;re only left with figuring out a strategy for studying.<p>What are my best strategies to stop procrastinating? I&#x27;m out of money. Time is running out. I have a gun to my head.<p>Getting things done is sometimes like trying to reach through a heavy fog to snatch a pin head size blinking orb of light. The moving swirling fog distracts and makes you lose site of the blinking thing you&#x27;re trying to keep in sight.<p>What you have to do is mentally banish the fog and go straight for that blinking thing and grab it.<p>Another issue for me is a failure to commit. The more I think about all the stuff I want to do, the less I&#x27;m willing to put the effort into doing one thing. Possibilities are more interesting than reality. Even as reality kills off possibilities, I can always spin up more. Reading HN is like a staging zone where I&#x27;m not having to commit to anything. I&#x27;m not getting anything done, but at least I&#x27;m still keeping all the possibilities in play. It&#x27;s like a dude who likes to play the field rather than settle down and get married. ;)<p>As I mentioned above, certain realities I can&#x27;t ignore. Paying bills is a major one.",

        "Procrastination is more about dreams, opportunities and possible outcomes than time management and emotions.<p>If you have the chance to win it big doing something you love you will find the time. If you have less of a chance or you don´t like it that much you won´t be able to find that much time. If what you have to do is something out of obligation or you don´t care at all you will procrastinate.<p>And it´s fine. It´s your inner compass trying to tell you that maybe this is not for you&#x2F;wasted effort.<p>In the short term the best strategy for procrastination is to put your pants on and do it. In the long term is making sense about why you are doing what you do and evaluating if it brings value to your life or not.",

        "I recently adopted a timed activity method. I make a list like: Eat, Watch TV, Code, Playing Games, Play Guitar etc. I then allocate a timeframe for each one. Every week night after work I do it like: 30m eating and watching netflix at the same time, 20m hard exercise, 60m guitar, 60m coding, 60m gaming, 60m reading. All timed with my smartphone. This is key. It must be timed with an alarm at the end. There&#x27;s always more or less 290 minutes available each night to allocate. If I remove one activity I just double the time of another one and so on. This way the procrastination was completely obliterated. Also I can more easily maintain really useful habits like exercise everyday, practice something everyday etc. I can exchange reading time for meditation time for example. At weekends it&#x27;s the same idea, just with more activities and&#x2F;or bigger time frames. The more time you have the easier it is to waste it all if you don&#x27;t organize yourself;",

        "&gt;<i>Chronic procrastination is linked with mental and physical health costs, from depression and anxiety ...</i><p>I would argue that anxiety can actually be a cause of procrastination. It turns into a nasty feedback loop that can go something like this:<p>Anxious -&gt; Procrastination -&gt; [Depression] -&gt; More anxious -&gt; Repeat<p>Depression of course depending on the circumstances, but it stands to reason if you&#x27;re a chronic procrastinator that frequently doesn&#x27;t get done what you want to get done, depression will often follow in some cases.<p>I had the privilege of experiencing this cycle first hand due to pharmacological reasons when I was on a xanthine derivative for nine months. Methylated xanthine is chemically similar to caffeine, so being hopped up on that 24&#x2F;7 was ultimately quite unpleasant. It was common for others to only tolerate the same medication for weeks due to anxiety issues. Once I went off the stuff, the procrastination ceased within days. It was like a new lease on life.<p>Which is ironic, because even years before that I&#x27;d always considered myself a bad procrastinator. No doubt habits and, to a greater extent emotional well-being (as the article states) are considerable factors.<p>I would also argue hypomanic features and ADHD can play a large role in procrastination as well. Furthermore, I suspect the two are often confused for one another and share similar pathology.",

        "I struggled with procrastination through much of my childhood and young adult life. Like most real-life problems, there is no magic solution, but I&#x27;ve found the most impactful helpers to be:<p>1. Having others depending on me. Since I&#x27;ve been married and had children, I&#x27;m the one who has to support them. This adds a little anxiety to the mix, of course, but it&#x27;s a net positive for me.<p>2. Removing things from my life that I do not need. Facebook, non-casual video games, unhealthy relationships, excessive &lt;fill in the blank&gt;. I find that this is not a one-time decision but rather a continual pruning of &quot;bad branches&quot; from my life.<p>3. Regular exercise. If I feel good about my activity level and my own body, I begin to find work and other responsibilities to be less of a drain.<p>4. Caffeine, but without overdoing it. If I drink a cup or two of coffee throughout the day, it allows me to focus in ways that are otherwise beyond my ability. Too much caffeine actually produces the opposite effect, and I&#x27;ll get nothing done.",

        'I&#x27;ve learned the most valuable things from the HowToADHD channel:<p>1.<p>Procrastination is related to fear, and the fight, flight &amp; freeze responses for work. Procrastination = flight. Pulling an all-nighter = fight (gets things done, but at a health cost).  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hlObsAeFNVk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=hlObsAeFNVk</a><p>2.<p>For people with ADHD (e.g. myself) there are two times: NOW and NOT NOW.\nThat way, it is hard to do any activity, unless is urgent (e.g. deadline). Anything for &quot;some time&quot; (or &quot;tomorrow&quot;) is going to stay that way. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YLkOZhROvA4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YLkOZhROvA4</a><p>...<p>Also, I recommend &quot;Driven to Distraction: Recognizing and Coping with Attention Deficit Disorder&quot; by Edward Hallowell and John Ratey. I discovered this book thanks to HN and a post about dyslexia. The book shows quite a few stories of adults with AD(H)D and how do they cope with work and relationships. The stories are diverse (it is certainly not all ill-behaved boys), and give a point of reference.<p>I wished I had known that book before. I got diagnosed only the last year, being 33 years old. Before turning 30 I hadn&#x27;t suspected having ADHD, as I had quite a few misconceptions both about the condition, and what is &quot;typical&quot; in humans.<p>...<p>And from recent things: this recent HN is invaluable: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22105229" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22105229</a><p>&gt; When you tell yourself &quot;just one more game&quot; or &quot;just one more post&quot;, or &quot;just one more video&quot; and end up doing 3-5 hours more, do that with your other tasks too! &quot;just one line of code&quot;, &quot;just one tutorial&quot;, &quot;just one rep&quot;, &quot;just one line of reading&#x2F;writing&quot;.<p>And from a linked Reddit post:<p>&quot;Eat the frog first doesn&#x27;t work for many of the groups who struggle with procrastination. My ADHD group often gets newcomers who say they&#x27;ve tried everything. There must be something terribly wrong with them because trying to eat the frog first makes things worse for them.<p>In fact, trying to eat the frog first makes it worse for most people with ADHD. We do better with small things, and even better with a small, well-chosen fun thing before the important thing. It builds dopamine and success and reduces anxiety. Also, sometimes we need to de-stress. Yes, I let my kids play video games after school. They relaxed until after supper. They knew that if they didn&#x27;t get their work done before class started, and were cranky from lack of sleep, we&#x27;d have to change the rules.&quot;',

Feeling good about yourself, feeling prepared and optimistic, feeling good about your body, all puts you in the right state of mind to achieve and &quot;exercise willpower&quot;. Being tired or out of shape really hurts that! So sleep well, eat well, and get some exercise.",

        "I really don&#x27;t see the point of studying statistical correlations between cat videos and heart disease.<p>The way I see it, these statistical correlations give you clues about where to start looking for mechanisms of causation, but as long as there is no causal mechanism, there&#x27;s just nothing there.  -- It&#x27;s like a detective forming a theory of a crime so they know where to start looking for evidence.  But the evidence is what a court is going to need to convict someone.<p>If you look purely at correlations, I bet that almost any psychological condition correlates with almost any other, to the extent that they are all caused by an unobserved outside factor.  Let&#x27;s call that factor &quot;having a shitty life&quot;.  A shitty life probably involves having a boring job, which makes you more likely to procrastinate.  But a shitty life will also make it more likely that you&#x27;d be an alcoholic, drug-addict, suffer from depression and&#x2F;or anxiety, etc etc",

        "When I first started Escitalopram (Lexapro), I noticed a marked improvement in my ability to get things done. I was a big exploiter of &quot;productive procrastination&quot;, where I would work on smaller jobs to procrastinate bigger ones. With the anti-anxiety medication, that stopped completely, and it became pretty clear that it was feelings of anxiety towards that big&#x2F;unknown&#x2F;unbounded&#x2F;boring&#x2F;detestable job that was fueling the procrastination.<p>Unfortunately, after about a year and a half, that all went away. Those baseless feelings of doom towards nebulously defined work creeped back. I found myself getting irritated at little things again. And on top of that, my work life had gotten significantly <i>better</i>, so it wasn&#x27;t like I could blame stress anymore. The drugs just seemed to stop fulfilling their beneficial purpose, leaving me only with the side-effects (insomnia, teeth-grinding, anorgasmia). So I weaned myself off.<p>Still irritable, but at least I can get to sleep at night, which is having a bigger effect on the irritability than the drugs did.",
